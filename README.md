# Rebar Calculator GUI

This Python application calculates the maximum number of rebars possible in each direction of a concrete section. The calculation is based on the minimum allowable rebar spacing, clear cover, confinement bar size, and moment frame type. The program also checks if the reinforcement percentage complies with the code requirements.

## Features

- Input for section dimensions, rebar diameter, clear cover, and confinement bar size.
- Selection of moment frame type (SMF or OMF/IMF).
- Calculates the number of rebars and checks against minimum clear spacing and code compliance.
- Provides output for rebar counts in both directions and clear spacing.

## Usage

1. Enter the section dimensions (depth and width in mm).
2. Select the rebar diameter and confinement bar size.
3. Input the clear cover and minimum allowable clear spacing.
4. Choose the moment frame type (SMF or OMF/IMF).
5. Press the `Calculate` button to get the number of rebars and clear spacing.
